# Robust-Trajectory-Tracking-for-Quadrotor-UAVs-using-Sliding-Mode-Control
The aim of this project was to develop a **sliding mode control** for a Quadrotor to enable it to autonomously track a trajectory. A mirco aerial vehicle (MAV) named [**Crazyflie 2.0**](https://www.bitcraze.io/products/old-products/crazyflie-2-0/) was used as a platform. For simulation ROS and Gazebo were used.
